=Project Overview=
The aim of the project is to create a CAD software having these features:

-Importing DXF files.

-Modifying the parts to insert an "attack angle" for cutting (maybe using radius compensation?).

-Saving the sheet as DXF.

-Exporting the file to G code.

-Automatic nesting of parts in the drawing sheet.
